# Looking at within Colombia sampling

Our Nextstrain build for analysis of zika transmission in Colombia allows the user to look at the tree colored by country, or by department within Colombia under `Color By` select `division` on the [zika-colombia nextstrain website](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/zika-colombia).

Within this directory you will find the SVG files that are downloads from that website, and are what I used to make the within-colombia figure for the paper.
