### Consensus genomes

This repo contains fasta files for each of the Colombian Zika genomes that we attempted sequencing on.

`ZIKA_COL_good.fasta` contains consensus genomes that have 80% or more unambiguous bases.

`ZIKA_COL_partial.fasta` contains consensus genomes that have between 50% and 80% unambiguous bases.

`ZIKA_COL_poor.fasta` contains the consensus genomes for samples that have less than 50% unambiguous bases. Many of these consensus genomes are entirely N, and we do not use these poor quality genomes in any part of the analysis. They are included here for completeness only.
